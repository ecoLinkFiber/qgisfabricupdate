# All hosts will be initially configured using lxc_container via
# localhost, and all hosts will be networked using ebgp ecmp.
# Once set up, management will move to more traditional management
# over the network, through the host definitions below.
#
# The system this is deployed on will be a bare metal system, or
# a VM. Vagrant is unused within this project. The host system
# will run gitlab for ci/cd development and ansible triggers. It
# will tie into the network somewhere within the ISP cloud, and
# will provide a default route to the network.
#[lxc-host]

# Spines will also serve as border edge routers facing public internet
